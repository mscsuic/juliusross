# Graduate Students

## Potential Graduate Students

My research spans algebraic geometry, complex geometry and analysis and I have various projects in mind for potential students in this area. If you are either an undergraduate or current UIC graduate student with interest in this area you are encouraged to get in touch with me.

Appropriate first and second-year courses to take include MATH535, MATH546, MATH550, MATH553, MATH533, MATH539, MATH551, MATH552, MATH554, MATH571 (but I certainly do not require that you have taken all of these!)
