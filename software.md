## Accessible LaTeX Thesis Template

Simple LaTeX template for writing thesis that is tested also with LaTeXML to produce accessible epub files.  It was written for a UIC thesis, but likely can be adapted easily ([source](https://github.com/juliusross1/Accessible-LaTeX-Thesis-Template))

## The Hele-Shaw Toolkit

(Joint with David Witt Nyström) This is a MATLAB package to simulate the Hele-Shaw flow in the plane with varying permeability ([source](https://github.com/juliusross1/HeleShawToolbox)).
