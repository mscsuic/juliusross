## [43] Generalized Bogomolov Inequalities  
**with M. Pavel and M. Toma**  
**Preprint:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04663

We introduce two notions, the first notion being a Hodge-Riemann pair and the second notion is that of a Bogomolov Pair. In both cases this can be either a pair of cohomology classes or a pair of forms; for simplicity in this summary we just consider the case of classes.

A Hodge-Riemann pair consists of a pair of cohomology classes on a compact Kahler manifold (or projective manifold) that generalizes the Hodge-Riemann property on \(H^{1,1}(X)\). A Bogomolov pair is a pair of cohomology classes that generalizes the classical Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for semistable sheaves.

We list known Hodge-Riemann pairs and show that nearly all are also Bogomolov pairs, conjecturing this is always true.

## [42] Realization of Cohomology Classes in Grassmannians  
**with I. Coskun**  
**Preprint:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03747

In this work we look at which cohomology classes in the Grassmannian \(G(k,n)\) can be represented by an irreducible variety. This can also be asked over \(\mathbb{Q}\): which classes have a positive multiple represented by an irreducible variety?

We solve this problem for:
- dimension 2  
- dimension 3  
- codimension 2  
- codimension 3  

in all Grassmannians, and more in special cases.

This relates to work of Huh on Lorentzian polynomials and representability in products of projective spaces.
