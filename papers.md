# [43] Generalized Bogomolov Inequalities  
**with M. Pavel and M. Toma**  
Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04663

We introduce two notions, the first notion being a Hodge-Riemann pair and the second notion is that of a Bogomolov Pair. In both cases this can be either a pair of cohomology classes or a pair of forms; for simplicity in this summary we just consider the case of classes.

A Hodge-Riemann pair consists of a pair of cohomology classes on a compact Kahler manifold (or projective manifold) that generalizes the Hodge-Riemann property on \(H^{1,1}(X)\). A Bogomolov pair is a pair of cohomology classes that generalizes the classical Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for semistable sheaves.

We list known Hodge-Riemann pairs and show that nearly all are also Bogomolov pairs, conjecturing this is always true.

# [42] Realization of Cohomology Classes in Grassmannians  
**with I. Coskun**  
Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03747

We study which cohomology classes in \(G(k,n)\) can be represented by irreducible varieties, including versions over \(\mathbb{Q}\). We solve this for dimensions 2, 3, codimension 2, and codimension 3 in all Grassmannians, plus more in special cases.

This builds on ideas related to Huh’s work on Lorentzian polynomials and representability in products of projective spaces.

# [41] Accessibility for the Working Mathematician  
Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22667

This is an informal introduction to creating accessible electronic documents for mathematicians. I originally hoped for a one‑page guide, but the topic is deeper, so this document collects essential knowledge in a slightly longer format.

# [40] Uniform boundedness of semistable pure sheaves on projective manifolds  
**with M. Pavel and M. Toma**  
Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12855

We give the first general **uniform boundedness theorem for pure sheaves of any rank** across infinitely many slope-stability conditions. For rank‑2 pure sheaves we prove even stronger results, resolving a question of Joyce.

# [39] Schur positivity of difference of products of derived Schur polynomials  
**with K. Wu**  
Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04101

Building on [35], we consider derived Schur polynomials \(s_\lambda^{(i)}\). Previously we proved  
\[
p = (s_\lambda^{(i)})^2 - s_\lambda^{(i-1)} s_\lambda^{(i+1)} \ge 0.
\]
We conjecture a stronger statement: **\(p\) is Schur-positive**. We prove this for certain partitions and verify numerically for others.

# [38] Harmonic Interpolation and a Brunn-Minkowski Theorem for Random Determinants  
**with D. Witt Nyström**  
Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09697

We describe harmonic interpolation of convex bodies, prove a strong Brunn–Minkowski inequality, characterize equality, and apply this to strengthen results on volumes of convex slices and to study expected absolute random determinants.

# [37] Dually Lorentzian Polynomials  
**with H. Seuss and T. Wannerer**  
Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08399

# [36] Interpolation, Prekopa and Brunn-Minkowski for F-subharmonicity

Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13816

We generalize the Brunn–Minkowski theorem to families of convex sets parameterized by domains using Harvey–Lawson F-subharmonic theory, giving log‑concavity of volume for natural interpolations.

# [35] Hodge-Riemann Relations for Schur Classes in the Linear and Kähler Cases
