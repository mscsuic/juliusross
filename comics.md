<img alt="Front cover of comic called Undergraduate Text in Mathematical Comics" src="./media/CABook.png">

With my friend and collaborator Andrea Tomatis, we have been exploring rigorous mathematical comics.  Our first release is a [short Tour of Complex Analysis](./media/UMTC-Complex Analysis.pdf).  Please share with anybody you think may be interested (we release under Creative Commons BY-NC-ND License).
